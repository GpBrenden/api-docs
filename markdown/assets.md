Assets refer to objects that are tracked with Samsara Asset Gateways. These include: trailers, reefers, equipment (construction, etc.), containers, and anything else you'd like to track with a Samsara Asset Gateway. This is different than Vehicles, which specifically have a Samsara Vehicle Gateway. Depending on the asset, different data is available. For all assets, GPS data is available. For powered assets like trailers, reefers, and equipment, other engine or on-board diagnostic data is available.
