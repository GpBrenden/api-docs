Driving activity is segmented into trips (travel between a start and a stop). Vehicle movement is broken down into trips along the following lines: a trip begins when a previously inactive vehicle achieves a speed of 5mph; the trip ends when the vehicle's speed remains below 5mph for 5 minutes, or when a vehicle crosses a state or national boundary. Trips contain start and stop times, locations, and addresses. Trips also contain distance and odometer information as well as fuel consumption.
