Carriers (fleet managers) can propose vehicle, trailer, and shipping assignments to Drivers through the Carrier Proposed Assignments API. This set of APIs will allow you to define an assignment proposal to a Driver. The proposed assignment will be presented to the Driver in the Samsara Driver App. The Driver may accept or reject the assignment. Retrieving a list of existing proposed assignments will tell you whether the Driver accepted or rejected the proposal.
