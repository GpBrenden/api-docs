Endpoints in this section are in beta. This means that developers should **NOT** rely on these APIs to build business critical applications. The goal is to be able to release these APIs in the near future but, before doing so, ensure that we can collect feedback on the structure of their interfaces and their functionality.

- Samsara may change the structure of a beta APIâ€™s interface without versioning this endpoint or any notice to beta users.

- To submit feedback on these beta APIs, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/up7uFmJ8f2EKq8xm7).

- When an endpoint becomes generally available, it will be announced in the API [changelog](https://developers.samsara.com/changelog).

- If an issue or bug is experienced with any of these APIs, please submit an entry in the [feedback form](https://forms.gle/up7uFmJ8f2EKq8xm7).
