A Vehicle object is created when a [Samsara Vehicle Gateway](https://www.samsara.com/products/models/vg34) is first activated. The Vehicle object will be assigned a unique ID that does not change. Samsara will associate all the telematics data from the gateway with the given Vehicle object. If a gateway is [moved from one vehicle to another](https://kb.samsara.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042699732-Moving-a-Vehicle-Gateway-from-One-Vehicle-to-Another), then a new Vehicle object will be created with a new ID. The old Vehicle object will still have its original ID and its historical data will still be accessible, however the gateway will no longer be associated with that vehicle object. You can manage a Vehicle's attributes (such as `name`, `licensePlate`, etc.) both through the API and the Samsara [cloud dashboard](https://cloud.samsara.com).
