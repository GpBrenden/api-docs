Endpoints in this section are in Preview. These APIs are not functional and are instead for soliciting feedback from our API users on the intended design of this API. Additionally, it is not guaranteed that we will be releasing an endpoint included in this section to production. This means that developers should **NOT** rely on these APIs to build business critical applications

- Samsara may change the structure of a preview API's interface without versioning or any notice to API users.
